OpenShift Kubernetes Scripts &amp; Commands

### Note
Most of these scripts are going to exclusively use the `oc` CLI client rather than `kubectl`.
These will generally be interchangeable with other implementations with the exception of
OpenShift-native custom resources (Routes, Projects, etc.) which do require use of `oc`.
